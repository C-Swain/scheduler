# Interview Scheduler
Thank you for you interest in my Scheduler App! This Scheduler was built as part of course Completion for the Web Development BootCamp at Lighthouse Labs, We were provided the necessary tools and instructions to create a working schedular that required both a React Server and an API Server. 

This Scheduler has been designed to allow appointments to be booked Mon-Fri between the hours of 12 pm -5pm. It is limmited to only allow one interview to be booked for time slot. Under the assumption that the Scheduler is booking the Use of a particular room. The scheduler is Dynamic as the selection of interviewers varies depending on the day to reflect their availablity. The database used for this Project was developed by Lighthouse Labs and uses PSQL .

## Final Product 
Here are some screenshots of the working app.

Canceling an appointment:

## Behaviour
